## Introduction

With this application, we can monitor current water level in the tank, the amount of hazardous gas buildup inside it, and the amount of electric power consumed by the pump(motor). Mean while we have indicator on the dashboard for indicating water over flow and a buzzer which sounds when water level reaches low.

To create this whole UI, react.js is used, to make api calls axios used, and for styling css is used.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Used as the main frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to the server.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsivness
